# we can connect to other docker containers by setting this ip address
# it works like a bind to 'localhost:9000'
# on windows/macos should be like: host.docker.internal:9000
# 172.17.0.1 is the default bridge network gateway
# Containers can access the host machine via the bridge IP (172.17.0.1)
# which allows them to reach other containers through the ports exposed on the host.
